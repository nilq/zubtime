# ZubTime

ü•ê The #1 software for my personal math assignments

## This is what we need.

- Something that mimics Jypyter notebooks.
- Has inline Hugorm code for solving the math.
  - Using the AST of said code, generate LaTeX math expression automatically.
  - In cases where it's possible, expressions are automatically evaluated.
- It is a REPL with cool colors.
